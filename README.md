#Getting and Cleaning Data Course

##Course Project

###Summary
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Here are the data for the project:

###Running the code
1. Fork this repository. You can also clone it or download it to your local drive.
2. Navigate to the folder in which this repository exists.


###Dependencies
The R script requires plyr to run.

run_analysis.R will help to install the dependencies if needed.
